        <h2>“This International Day of Happiness is more than just a fun celebration, it also remind us all that the world is a better place when we connect with and care about the people around us”

            <div class="first">
                <p>In 2011, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which recognised happiness as a “fundamental human goal” and called for “a more inclusive, equitable and balanced approach to economic growth that promotes the happiness and well-being of all peoples”.

                    In 2012 the first ever UN conference on Happiness took place and the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which decreed that the International Day of Happiness would be observed every year on 20 March. It was celebrated for the first time in 2013.

                <p>On World Happiness Day, the United Nations General Assembly calls for people to make more continuous progress and the small things that continue to make their lives better.

                    Share happiness with friends and family on the International Day of Happiness. Taking the time to note and appreciate what oneself have to be thankful for, even the little things, will make people feel happier and more fulfilled in life. Consider making this a daily habit, such as keeping a gratitude log. Spend time with loved ones and try to repair any relationships that are going through a tough patch since good quality relationships are crucial to happiness. Try a step-by-step program, where you meet with like-minded individuals on a daily basis to assist each other in taking action and living healthier lives. You may also donate to or work with a charity that encourages good deeds of your choosing. Social networking is another way to connect with others. It's a particularly powerful tool on this day because it helps us to instantly share and spread our activities, as well as the joy they bring, all over the world
